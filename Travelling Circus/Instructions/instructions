Hello! 

I'm so glad you've made it. Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Mister Wanston. I am the Ringmaster of this Travelling Circus. I call you to help because someone has let all my animals loose into the circus during my last show! I can't seem to find any of them and I need them all in the SHOW ROOM in time for the next show. 

I've was informed that you've been learning how to use 'cd' and 'ls' effectively, so you should be able to do this job, no problem!

Enter the tent and start moving any animals you can find into the show room!
